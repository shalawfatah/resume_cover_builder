# SEND THE RIGHT RESUME 
We all have a fixed CV, but what if we use AI to tweak the CV to a better version of itself in one click? This web app is just that. 
- Upload your CV first. 
- Upload or paste the job posting you want to apply to 
- The app gives you a suitable summary, skillset and title 
- The app is only to help you pick and choose a version of yourself better suited for the job. 
- It also saves the job (title, company, date applied) to warn you if you want to re-apply to the same job
